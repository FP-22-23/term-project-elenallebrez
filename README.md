#### Programming term project (Curse 22/23)

Author: Elena Fern√°ndez-Llebrez, UVUS: LMX8564

The main propouse of this project is to analayze the data about students in a random campus. 
This data set is publised in this URL (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement). The original data set has 15 columns, which none of them was a date type. Therefore, I had delete some columns, choosing only 12 out of 15 colummns and I added one columns with dates generated randomly, which it will refer to the date when the student finished the MBA course.

### Structure of the project's folders
- **/src**: It contains the differents Python modules that made up the project
 1. module1.py: It contains the function to analyze the dataset
 2. module1_test.py: It contais the functions tests to prove the function of the module1.
 3. graphics.py: It contains the functions related to graphics

- **/data**: It contains the dataset of the project:
1. data_set.csv: File that contains all the data about the students

### Structure of the data set
Each row contain the data of more or less 200 students, whose names and surnames are unknows.
For each student is registered 13 columns, for that reason the data set is made up by 15 columns:
- **sl_no**: int type, serial number
- **gender**:str type, gender, it can be male(M) or female(F)
- **ssc_p**: float type, Secondary Education percentage-10th Grade
- **hsc_p**:float type, Higher Education percentage-12th Grade
- **hsc_s**:str type, Specialization in Higher Secondary Education
- **degree_p**: float type, Degree Percentage
- **degree_t**: str type, Field of degree education
- **workex**: boolean type, Work experience
- **etest**: float type, Employability test percentage
- **specialisation**: str type, Post Graduation(MBA)-Specialization
- **mba_p**: float type, MBA percentage
- **status**: str type, Status of placement
- **finish_date**: date type, date when they finished the MBA course

### Implemented types
To work with the data from the dataset, I have created a named tuple:

`maintuple=namedtuple("Student_number", "sl_no,gender,ssc_p,hsc_p,hsc_s,degree_p,degree_t,workex,etest_p,specialisation,mba_p,status,finish_date")`

### Implemented functions

#### First delivery
The first function implemented is:
- read_dataset(file): it reads the csv file and returns a list of named tuples.

#### Second delivery
In this delivery I have implemented the following functions:

#### Block 1
- **preuniversity_p_filter(mylist, p=70.00)**:Given a list of tuples and a value for the percentage, this function filter the percentage of the higher secondary education and the percentage of the secondary school. It shows the people who reach and pass the 75%.

- **working_students(mylist, work = True, now = "Placed")**: Given a list of tuples, this function returns the students that have working experience and are now working
- diferent_specialization(mylist): This function returns three different sets. The first set are the specialization options at the institute, the second, the undergraduate options, and the last set the master's specialization options.

- **average_degree_percentage(mylist)**: Given a list of tuples, this function returns the value of the sum, the number of students and the average of the total degree percentage.

#### Block 2
- **max_degree_p_by_year(mylist, year)**:Given a list of tuples and a determined year, this function returns the maximun degree percentage of the determined year
- **max_min_degree_p(mylist)**: This function returns two values the highest degree percentage and the lowest degree percentage
- **order_mba_p_by_gender(mylist, p=65.0, m ="M", n = 3)**:Given a list of tuples and two numbers and determined gender, this function order a list where it appears the 3 men with the highest score that reached and pass the 65% of the degree.
- **group_hsc_s(mylist)**: This function returns a dictionary whose keys are the types of specializations of Higher Education and the value of each key is a list with the serial number of the students who chose that specialization.

###Third delivery

### Block 3
- **number_hsc_s(mylist)**: this function returns a dictionary whose keys are the types of specializations of Higher Education and the value is the number of students that chose that specialization
- **number_degree_t(mylist)**:this function returns a dictionary whose keys are the types of specializations of degree and the value is the number of students that chose that specialization
- **number_specialization(mylist)**:  this function returns a dictionary whose keys are the types of specializations of the master and the value is the number of students that chose that specialization
-  **max_number_hsc_s(mylist)**: It returns the Higher Education specialization with more students
-  **max_number_degree_t(mylist)**: It returns the degree specialization with more students
-  max_number_specialization(mylist): It returns the master specialization with more students
-  **max_percentage(mylist)**: Given a list of tuples, this function returns a dictionary whose keys are the types tests and the value is the maximun percentage of each type
-  **topn_percentage_working(mylist, n = 5)**: Given a list of tuples and a parameter, this function returns a dictionary whose keys are the types tests and the value of each key is a list with the five highest percentage
-  **porcentage_working(mylist)**: This function is given a list of tuples and it returns the porcentage of the students that are currently working
-  **percentage_A(mylist)**: This function is given a list of tuples and it returns the porcentage of the students that has a 75 or more in all the tests

### Test module
The following test functions have been defined in the test module, each of which is used to test the function with the same name. 
- **test_preuniversity_p_filter(mylist, p=70.00)**
- **test_working_students(mylist, work = True, now = "Placed")**
- **test_diferent_specialization(mylist)**
- **test_average_degree_percentage(mylist)**
- **test_max_degree_p_by_year(mylist, year)**
- **test_max_min_degree_p(mylist)**
- **test_order_mba_p_by_gender(mylist, p=65.0, m ="M", n = 3)**
- **test_group_hsc_s(mylist)**
- **test_number_hsc_s(mylist)**
- **test_number_degree_t(mylist)**
- **test_number_specialization(mylist)**
- **test_max_number_hsc_s(mylist)**
- **test_max_number_degree_t(mylist)**
- **test_max_number_specialization(mylist)**
- **test_max_percentage(mylist)**
- **test_topn_percentage_working(mylist, n = 5)**
- **test_porcentage_working(mylist)**
- **test_percentage_A(mylist)**

### Graphic Module
This module contains the following functions for drawing graphs:

## Block 4
- **show_degree_p(mylist)**: This function returns a bar graph, where the x-axis is the years and the y-axis is the average of the grades of the degree of each year.
- **def show_working(mylist)**: this function returns a pie chart where you can see which people are working now and which are not. You can see that it corresponds to the function porcentage_working
